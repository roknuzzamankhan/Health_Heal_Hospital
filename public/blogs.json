Not only will the child be healthier, but they’ll learn the importance of proper discipline and healthy habits when it comes to food and exercise.",

    "blog": "Stretching safely exposes your body to the strenuous limits that your sport or activity may introduce. By stretching in advance, it “prepares” the body for meeting those limits as they occur by loosening up the muscles slowly and carefully. Without stretching, if your muscle is forced to endure certain limits (typically very quickly and strongly), it can cause damage to the muscles. Stretching in advance will reduce the risk of injury because the muscle is already “prepared” for that exertion of force.",

    "blog": "Obesity can affect anyone, even if other age groups or demographics may be at larger risk. This is why it’s very important to monitor the types of activities that children are engaged in. While childhood obesity is a result of many different variables and factors, one of the largest contributors is taking part in an excessive amount of sedentary activities. Such activities include watching television, playing games on the computer, browsing the internet, watching videos online, and similar activities. While these are not inherently problematic, they can become a problem when done excessively.",
